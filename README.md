* **0_DatasetCreation**: In this folder, you can find the code that we used to create the ground-truth dataset.

* **0_DatasetInsight**: Here, you can find the code we used to analyze our ground-truth dataset and provide interesting statistics about the dataset itself. For example, we show the (dis)alignment with Google Play Categories.
