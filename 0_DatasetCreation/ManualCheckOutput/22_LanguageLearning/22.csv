Mondly is the quick fix that will teach you core Greek words and Greek phrases for conversation, just like a phrasebook. If you want to learn beyond the basics, there are also Greek grammar lessons available.  With Mondly you can learn Greek sentences and expressions FREE with daily Greek language lessons online. This app is the effective way for beginners to study verbs, pronunciation and how to speak like a native with daily practice.  <b>The secret path to language learning</b> Remember the Greek language classes in school? You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, continued with tons of Greek grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely translate a sentence or say “Hello!” to a local. Does it sound familiar? That’s the traditional way to learn a language. But it’s not the fastest and not the most efficient way. Mondly has a different approach, that’s opposite to the average language course.  <b>This is how the future of language courses looks like</b> The App gets you started with a basic conversation between two people. You quickly start memorizing core words, use them to build sentences and phrases, and at the end of a 45-minutes module you are able to reconstruct that conversation with your own voice. It’s an effective way to learn Greek phrases. State-of-the-art Natural Speech Recognition and Spaced Repetition Algorithms make the app effective for learning languages.  Here are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:  <b>- Crystal-clear audio and professional voice actors.</b> Learn the right Greek pronunciation from conversations between native speakers.  <b>- State-of-the-art Speech Recognition.</b> Mondly knows exactly how to listen to your Greek words and phrases. You will only get a positive feedback if you speak Greek clearly and correctly. This will improve your pronunciation.  <b>- Useful phrases for real situations.</b> Memorizing hundreds of words is not the way to go when it comes to learning Greek. Mondly teaches you Greek vocabulary by offering you core words and phrases. The app breaks the learning process down into bite-size chunks and puts them into themed packs of lessons.  <b>- Learn conversational Greek.</b> Unless you plan on reading science books, conversation is the main reason to take this free course. It will help you build a core Greek vocabulary with widely-used nouns and verbs and speak Greek clearly.  <b>- Verb conjugations.</b> Conversations are fun, but the foundation of a foreign language is grammar. If you want to learn more during this course, just tap the Greek verbs and get the full conjugation on the screen, including the translation. It’s faster and better than a dictionary.  <b>- Statistics that make sense.</b> The App uses intelligent reporting, so you can always follow your progress. Build your vocabulary step by step and become better daily.  <b>- The Leaderboard.</b> We made learning easy and fun, so why not throw in some more game elements, such as score? See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner in the Mondly family. Take the Weekly Quiz to become even better.  <b>- Adaptive Learning.</b> We wanted to craft Mondly in such a way that it will suit every learner’s needs, even complete beginners. Along the way we noticed that learning Greek is different from person to person. So we taught the app to learn from your way of learning. After little time spent together, Mondly will understand what suits you best and it will become your own guide and customized teacher.  Before you know it, at the end of these Greek lessons, you will master the most useful 5000 words and phrases and you will be on the fast lane to learning a new language."

The more you use the app, the better it understands your unique learning journey.  Get level placed for free, and use Lingvist for 14 days before you decide whether to continue with a paid subscription.  Lingvist helps you cultivate a healthy routine and lets you know once you’ve exceeded the optimal amount of daily study time. Rather than flood your brain with reward signals when you correctly answer a question well below your level, Lingvist keeps you challenged and shows you data on the progress you’ve made.  With the help of an intelligent spaced repetition algorithm that continuously learns from our user base, Lingvist presents you problems that are on the tip of your tongue, just as you’re about to forget them.  Lingvist is designed for people who want to take their comprehension to the next level. Alongside a deck based on the most frequently used words in your target language, you can tailor the course with handcrafted decks in specialist subjects, ensuring that you’ll be ready for the language encounters relevant to you.  		 You can even prepare to have comfortable conversations about niche topics by uploading a textbook or Wikipedia article and having Lingvist generate a custom deck based on the content. Both custom and built-in Lingvist decks present your target vocabulary in a variety of realistic settings.  Lingvist doesn’t replace the most fun and important part of learning a language – speaking it with real people – instead, it will give you a firm foundation of vocabulary, with grammar tips concisely integrated into the experience, allowing you to rely on whichever balance of intuition and logic suits you best.  If you want to reach your language learning goals faster, whether it's fluency, confidence, or more technical vocabulary, there’s no app like Lingvist. From beginner to advanced user, there’s always a new idiom or grammatical structure to learn.  Full courses are available in European or Latin American Spanish, French, Japanese, German, Brazilian Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, Russian, Korean and Estonian. Speakers of other languages (Simplified Chinese, Hindi, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, Polish, Arabic and Ukrainian) can also learn English grammar and business English vocabulary with Lingvist.  No wonder users keep saying, “This is the best vocabulary app I’ve ever had!”  Learn French Grammar organically, practice for the Diplôme Approfondi de Langue Française (DALF), and breeze through your finals! Understand the dialect – study the particular expressions of Mexican Spanish or Spanish from Spain. Learn German, learn Dutch, learn Italian – we keep adding new languages. Progress efficiently in your target language with a vocabulary builder app that adapts to you.  Personalize your learning experience to best suit you, whether it’s enforcing correct diacritics or ultra-slow audio playback. Soak up the real language as it’s actually spoken, including curses and swear words, figures of speech, and flirty expressions.
