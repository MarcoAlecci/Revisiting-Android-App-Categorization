Nobody loves to spend hours in the kitchen following long instructions. That’s why the vast majority of Mary’s recipes take up to 25 minutes. Or even less.  HEALTHY MEANS DELICIOUS Healthy food can be delicious. It can have rich flavors. Healthy food does not necessarily require cutting off seasonings, spices, or herbs. Mary's recipes will make you enjoy the food to the last piece. Reward your body with healthy, nutritious, and delicious food.  MEAL PLANNER Planning meals for your family ahead saves lots of your time and takes the most stressful question off your shoulders: What’s for dinner? A variety of recipes for each category is available: breakfasts, soups and stews, snacks, hot meals, salads, drinks, desserts, and dips. You can use an offered by the app week menu (no decision-making required) or find the best meal recipe for you and your family.  VEGETARIAN, VEGAN, NO-SUGAR, GLUTEN-FREE Mary’s recipes app has a range of filters to meet your personal food preferences and dietary needs. You can select vegetarian, vegan recipes, gluten-free, and no-sugar recipes for people with diabetes. Filter the recipes if you have peanuts, tree nuts, dairy, eggs, gluten, fish, and seafood allergies.  DAILY TIPS FOR PARENTS Created by Maria Kardakova, daily tips will help parents and their kids build healthy relationships with food.  GROCERY LIST Your grocery list will be automatically created once a menu for a day or a week is organized. With a single tap, all ingredients will be directly added to the shopping lists. If you need to add more items to your grocery list, it’s there as well.  STORE INTEGRATION (UK, US, Australia) Add your favorite recipe or entire menu to your shopping cart and use the latest store integration technology to shop online without leaving the app. The service is available when using the English version of the application in the following countries: the UK, Australia, and USA.  MINIMAL FOOD WASTE A weekly meal planner and grocery list will help you cut down on food waste as much as possible, as well as reduce your expense. What’s also important – smart consumption saves the Earth's natural resources.  MIXER The mixer is a fun and useful tool that generates a menu for the day or simply gives you an idea of what you can cook for dinner. Kids love playing with this tool, and we have to admit that adults do too.   The Mary's recipes app is created by Maria Kardakova MSc. Registered Associate Nutritionist, Senior Associate, The Royal Society of Medicine."

Welcome to my app! My name is Jenny, and I am the creator of the EatMorePlants app. My own journey towards a plant-based diet started some years ago. I was suffering from constant lack of energy (fatigue), as well as frequent and recurring minor illnesses. Being introduced to the whole-food, plant-based diet changed my way of living. The transition provided me with so many benefits. I felt both my energy level and health significantly improved. The idea that others may benefit of a plant-based diet the same way as I did, inspired me to develop and launch EatMorePlants.  The plant-based lifestyle has a wide variety of advantages that extend beyond you. The future of sustainable living and the future of our ecosystem will partly depend on our ability to adapt a more plant-based diet, and to do that we need great recipes at hand!  I believe balance is key. It doesn’t have to be all or nothing. Do the best you can, whenever you can!  RECIPES: The app is filled with 100+ delicious vegan plant-based recipes, using easy-to-find ingredients, that will nourish your body, but never compromise on taste! I prefer to keep food simple and keep it as whole as possible. New recipes every week!  MEAL PLANS: If you are new to the plant-based lifestyle it is crucial that you know where to find all the essential nutrients you need. In collaboration with a certified nutritionist we have created specified weekly meal plans for you to follow.  SHOPPING LIST: To make shopping as easy as possible, every ingredient you select in a recipe can be added to an automatically generated shopping list. You can also shuffle the list to categorize all your ingredients by where they are located in the grocery store or by recipe. You can also add your own items to the shopping list, be it a toothbrush or a cactus.  APP FEATURES: - 100+ delicious plant-based recipes. - All recipes show calculated nutrition information. - Filter your recipes by gluten-free, nut-free, oil-free or soy-free. - Adjust the number of servings needed. - Weekly meal plans developed in cooperation with certified nutritionists. - Automatic generated shopping list for your planned meals. - Save your favourite recipes so you easily find them next time. - Browse tons of categories like pasta & noodles, baked & stuffed, wraps & burgers. - No-screen sleep when you’re viewing a recipe.

Dessert is a course that concludes a meal. The course usually consists of sweet foods, such as confections dishes or fruit, and possibly a beverage such as a dessert wine. However, in the United States, it may include coffee, cheeses, nuts, or other savory items regarded as a separate course elsewhere.  The term dessert can apply to many confections, such as biscuits, cakes, cookies, custards, gelatin, ice creams, pastries, pies, puddings, sweet soups, candies, and tarts. The fruit is also commonly found in dessert courses because of its naturally occurring sweetness. Some cultures sweeten foods that are more commonly savory to create desserts.  Dessert cooking is art, but it doesn't require any cooking expertise. Quick and easy desserts are very convenient to make and are very healthy. The most important fact is that desserts can be used as a sugar-free recipe. Sugars contribute moisture and tenderness to baked goods. Flour or starch components serves as a protein and gives the dessert structure. Fats contribute moisture and can enable the development of flaky layers in pastries and pie crusts. The dairy products in baked goods keep the desserts moist. Many desserts also contain eggs, to form custard or to aid in the rising and thickening of a cake-like substance. Egg yolks specifically contribute to the richness of desserts.  Sweet desserts usually contain cane sugar, palm sugar, honey or some types of syrup such as molasses, maple syrup, treacle, or corn syrup. Other common ingredients in Western-style desserts are flour or other starches. Cooking fats such as butter or lard, dairy, eggs, salt, acidic ingredients such as lemon juice, and spices and other flavoring agents such as chocolate, peanut butter, fruits, pudding, and nuts. The proportions of these ingredients, along with the preparation methods, play a major part in the consistency, texture, and flavor of the end product.  <b>THE APP EXPERIENCE</b>  This app is simple to navigate and also has multiple tutorials available on how to use the app. As the recipe is a set of instructions for cooking, our app also provides nutritional information, servings, total time for preparation and recommendations so that nothing can go wrong when you’re cooking.  <b>Smart shopping list for your baking</b>  An organized shopping list allows the user to create ingredients list so you won’t miss any for the recipe.

In their oldest forms, cakes were modifications of bread, but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple or elaborate, and which share features with desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards, and pies.  The most common ingredients include flour, sugar, eggs, fat (such as butter, oil or margarine), a liquid, and a leavening agent, such as baking soda or baking powder. Common additional ingredients include dried, candied, or fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa, and extracts such as vanilla, with numerous substitutions for the primary ingredients. Cakes can also be filled with fruit preserves, nuts or dessert sauces (like custard, jelly, cooked fruit, whipped cream or syrups), iced with buttercream or other icings, and decorated with marzipan, piped borders, or candied fruit.  Cake is often served as a celebratory dish on ceremonial occasions, such as weddings, anniversaries, and birthdays. There are countless cake recipes; some are bread-like, some are rich and elaborate, and many are centuries old. Cake making is no longer a complicated procedure; while at one time considerable labor went into cake making (particularly the whisking of egg foams), baking equipment and directions have been simplified so that even the most amateur of cooks may bake a cake.  list of <b>Cake Recipes offline</b> :  - Chocolate Cake Recipes - Apple Cake Recipes - Banana Cake Recipes - Blueberry Cake Recipes - Carrot Cake Recipes - Coconut Cake Recipes - Lemon Cake Recipes - Peach Cake Recipes - Pineapple Cake Recipes - Strawberry Cake Recipes - Birthday Cake Recipes  => Fruit Cake.  - Southern Strawberry Cake - Banana Cake - Apple Butter Cake - Mango Cake Recipe - Strawberry Cream Cake - Caramel Glazed Pear Cake - Banana Pudding Cake - Apple Cake - Fruit Vanilla Cake Recipe - Strawberry Cream Roll - Butterscotch Apple Cake - Pine Apple Fruit Cake - Blueberry Snack Cake - Hazelnut Coconut Fruitcake - Brown Butter Cake - One Bowl Vegan Pine Apple  => Chocolate Cake  - Chocolate Raspberry Cake - Chocolate Coconut Cake - Vanilla Sheet Cake - Chocolate Ice cream Cake Recipe - Flourless Chocolate Cake - Choco Whipped Cream Cake - Sponge Chocolate Cake - Chocolate Oreo Cake - Easy Chocolate Cake - Chocolate lava cake - Chocolate Peanut Cake Recipe - Marble Bundt Cake - 3-Ingredient Ice Box Cake - Choco-Coconut Pound Cake  => Cream Cake  - Butter Cake - Pound Cake - Genoise Cake - Angel Food Cake - Chiffon Cake Recipe - Carrot Cake - Vegan Frozen Cheesecake - Fruit Vanilla Cake - Red Velvet Cake - Butterscotch Apple Cake - Cheesecake Recipe - Lemon Cream Cake - Pine Apple Cream Cake - Mango Meringue Cake Recipe - Cherry Cheesecake  => Breakfast Cakes  - Cinnamon Cake - Quick Breakfast Cake - Easy Coffee Cake - Lemon Yogurt Cake - Banana Coconut Cake - Soft Vanilla Cake Recipe - Classic Banana Bread - Raspberry Grapefruit Cake - Pecan Peach Muffins - Fun fetti Cinnamon Rolls - Baked Snickerdoodle Donuts - Bananas Foster Scones - Blueberry Breakfast Cake Recipe - Cinnamon Roll Coffee Cake - Hot Milk Cake  => Cup Cakes.  - Red Velvet Cupcakes - Chocolate Cupcakes - Apple Pie Cupcakes Recipe - Salted Caramel Cupcakes - Butterbeer Cupcakes - Fudgy Vegan CupCake Recipe - Vanilla Cupcakes - Lemon Cupcakes - Orange creme Cupcake  features Cake Recipe Book :  1) Easy User Interface 2) Share Recipes to Your friends and Family 3) Can make favorite recipe 4) No Internet connection required for recipe 5) Search Recipes from the big list 6) Smooth Performance 7) 1000+ list cake recipes   Download our app and enjoy cooking.
