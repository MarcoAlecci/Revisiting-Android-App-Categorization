The Epic desktop browsers have been rated excellent by PC Magazine, awarded 5 out of 5 stars (‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è) by CNET, and reviewed favorably in dozens of publications. Epic for Windows and Mac are used by millions of users around the world.  Epic for Android is free with no in-app purchases.      Epic for Android includes many features:  ‚ú¥	Built on Chromium for Speed and Security.  ‚ú¥	File Vault.  Encrypt any files you download or store on your Android device to protect your privacy.    ‚ú¥	AdBlocker.  Install it for free via the Epic Extensions store.  Epic was the first browser to block cryptomining scripts and now offers that protection to Android users.  Epic's AdBlocker blocks ads, trackers, cryptomining scripts, popups and more.  ‚ú¥	Strict No-Logging Encrypted Proxy (VPN for the browser).  Install our Proxy for free via the Epic Extensions store.  Our Encrypted Proxy is essentially a free, unlimited VPN for the browser powered by hundreds of servers in eight countries including the United Statesüá∫üá∏, Canadaüá®üá¶, the United Kingdomüá¨üáß, Franceüá´üá∑, Germanyüá©üá™, the Netherlandsüá≥üá±, Singaporeüá∏üá¨ and IndiaüáÆüá≥.  ‚ú¥	Audio Queue.  On the road?  Going for a run?  Add webpages to Epic's audio queue and Epic will read the articles to you.  Epic is the first-ever web browser to use Android's text-to-speech support for this accessibility feature.  ‚ú¥	Fingerprinting Protection.  Epic blocks multiple fingerprinting techniques used by data collectors.  ‚ú¥	Encrypted Connection Preference.  Epic tries to connect to websites using an encrypted connection whenever possible.  ‚ú¥	Always-On Private / Incognito Browsing.  No browsing history.  ‚ú¥	Easy Menu-based ""Close All Tabs & Delete Data"" Option.  ‚ú¥	Granular, Site-Based Privacy Settings Controls.  If a site isn't working, you can disable ad & tracker blocking (if you've installed adblocker) as well as other privacy protections.  If a site is slow or questionable, you can disable scripts for a site (note this is an advanced setting that may suppress some or all site functionality depending on the website).  ‚ú¥	Tracker Count. See how many trackers are blocked in your browsing sessions when the AdBlocker is installed (typically thousands!).  ‚ú¥	Bookmark Support.  ‚ú¥	Password Saving Support. Optional for sites of your choice.  ‚ú¥	Reader Mode Button. Convert pages to text-only for easy reading.  ‚ú¥	Built-in Video Downloader.  Download videos from many websites (YouTube is not supported due to Google policies).  ‚ú¥	Customized Dials on the New Tab Page.  Set each dial on Epic's new tab page to one of your choice.  No browsing history to report on your ""most visited sites"".  Try Epic.  We think you'll love the faster, more private and convenient ""Epic"" browsing experience.  Epic has historically been one of the few if not the only browser to offer both security and comprehensive privacy out-of-the-box.  Many other so-called privacy browsers often don't have an encrypted proxy built-in or use the TOR network which should be considered insecure as many nodes are run by hackers and other malicious agents.  To configure other browsers for privacy often requires many untrustworthy extensions and multiple, complicated settings pages--all of which won't achieve the level of privacy to which Epic has been engineered.  We're proud to bring the same protections we've been providing for five years on PCs and Macs to Android users.

A proxy browser is a web browser that uses a proxy server to connect to the internet. When you use a proxy browser, your internet traffic is routed through the proxy server, which acts as an intermediary between your device and the internet. The proxy server can be located anywhere in the world, and it can be used to access websites and services that may be restricted in your location.  How Does a Proxy Browser Work?  When you use a proxy browser, all of your internet traffic is routed through the proxy server, which means that your IP address is hidden from the websites you visit. This can help protect your privacy online, as your internet service provider (ISP) and other third parties won't be able to see what you're doing online.  Additionally, using a proxy browser can help you bypass censorship and access content that may be restricted in your location. This is because the proxy server can be located in a different country, which means that you can use it to access content that may be blocked in your location.  Benefits of Using a Proxy Browser  There are many benefits to using a proxy browser, including:  1. Enhanced Privacy: When you use a proxy browser, your online activity is protected from prying eyes. This can help protect your personal information and prevent tracking by third parties.  2. Bypass Censorship: If you're traveling to a country that censors certain websites or services, a proxy browser can help you bypass these restrictions and access the content you need.  3. Improved Security: Using a proxy browser can help protect your data from interception or monitoring on public Wi-Fi networks.  4. Access Blocked Content: By connecting to a proxy server in a different country, you can access content that may be blocked in your location.</b></b>"
