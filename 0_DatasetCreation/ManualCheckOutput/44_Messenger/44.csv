During verification, select the “Call me” option to receive the code over a phone call.  • RUN BOTH WHATSAPP MESSENGER AND WHATSAPP BUSINESS: You can use both WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Messenger on the same phone, but each app must have its own unique phone number.  • WHATSAPP WEB: You can more efficiently respond to your customers right from your computer's browser.

Send and receive texts and pictures—seamlessly—from your computer, tablet, car, or any device with an internet connection.   <b>This is text messaging, done right.</b>  ---------  <b>A Taste of the Features</b> Pulse SMS is jam packed with features. On top of syncing between all of your devices, here is a small taste of what makes it the <b>ultimate text messaging experience</b>: - Unparalleled design and fluid animations - Endless global and per-conversation customization options - Suggested <i>Smart Replies</i> within conversations - Password protected, <i>private</i> text conversations - Share GIFs with your messages, from <i>Giphy</i> - Powerful searching through messages and conversations - Automatic message backup and restore with a Pulse SMS account - Preview web links - Blacklist pesky spammers - Delayed sending to give you time to edit or cancel messages you send - Automated replies based on contacts, keywords, and driving/vacation modes - Dual-SIM support  <b>Encryption Protocol</b> First and foremost, all of your conversations are stored in <b>end-to-end encryption</b>. You never have to worry about your data leaking out and no one can see your messages except for you, not even the Pulse SMS Team! With Pulse SMS, you get privacy and peace of mind, right out of the box.  <b>Privacy Protection Proof</b> In technical terms, we use PBKDF2 to encrypt your password and use it as a key to encrypt messages and conversations.  <b>Technical Encryption Overview</b>  1) When an account is created, we generate two salts. One to use with authentication and one for end-to-end encryption.  2) The one that we use with login is straight-forward and normal. We store a version of your password, hashed against the first salt, and authenticate you against this hash.  3) For the encryption, we hash your password against salt #2 and store it locally on your device (computer/tablet/phone). Having this key is the only way that you can decrypt messages. Since no one else has the password that was hashed against the second salt, no one else will be able to decrypt anything.  We share our privacy protocol publicly so our users have peace of mind knowing their password is never stored anywhere and without that password, there is no way to create the secret key used for encrypting and decrypting the content stored in the backend.  <b>Supported Platforms</b> <i>Pulse SMS</i> has a web app that you can use. It also has native apps for tablets, <i>MacOS</i>, <i>Windows</i>, <i>Google Chrome</i>, <i>Firefox</i>, <i>Linux</i>, and even <i>Android TV</i>.

Not anymore.   The world’s first end-to-end encrypted, metadata shredding, quantum-secure messaging app is here – the xx messenger empowers users to create and correspond in confidence while simultaneously achieving the independence, speed, and security required to protect your communications far into the future.   Those of us looking for a way to protect our right to privacy now have xx messenger, which accomplishes this in three ways:  1. Metadata Shredding: When using xx messenger, nobody can know who you communicate with. While all other messaging apps capture and potentially exploit information about your messaging patterns, xx network shreds this information by mixing messages through randomly-chosen xx network nodes around the world, making it impossible for any observer to trace your communications.  2. Quantum-Resistance: All of what you say over xx messenger will remain private, period. Due to advancements in quantum computing, messages sent over any other messenger eventually will be retroactively decoded and analyzed. Unlike other platforms, the xx messenger is quantum-resistant with privacy guarantees built to last.  3. Full Decentralization: xx network is a transparent, open-source blockchain hosted by hundreds of node operators in more than 80 countries around the world. With messages making at least five random hops between nodes, each message takes one out of hundreds of billions of unique paths to its destination. While the open-source code allows for review by the brightest minds in cryptography, decentralization prevents any government, no matter how powerful, from interfering with the network.   Innovators of early, practical, and verifiable cryptographic systems have come together to architect this system. Team members, led by cryptography pioneer David Chaum, were among the first to propose and deploy digital currencies, mixed networks, verifiable voting systems, and numerous other advances in modern cryptography.  A rebalancing of economic power and rewards is underway. The time is now to adapt to this new iteration of the web – one that doesn’t profit from the exploitation of your data. xx messenger is the first and only messenger built with a foundation of lasting privacy and security in the age of modern cryptography."

Olvid guarantees you safe spaces, immune to external aggression, which isolate you from the digital noise and violence of other social networks.
