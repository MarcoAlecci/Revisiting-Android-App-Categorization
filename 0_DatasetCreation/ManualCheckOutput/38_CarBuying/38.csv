Cars bought in car auctions are safer than other sources such as private car sellers or online. In fact, you can assess hundreds of cars at one auction location.  No damaged vehicles - Ready to drive cars  Every day the government, banks and various organizations take possession of seized cars, trucks, vans, motorcycles and more. The volume of these seized properties are so high that a fast and constant way to empty their inventories is in place. To do this auctions are held nationwide that empty inventories at discounted prices. Vehicles with prices up to 90% under blue book value are auctioned off every day  The good news is that every citizen has a right to these car auctions.  The bad news is that not everyone actually has access to these auctions, or let alone knows where they are held. You are probably one of those persons.  Auctions are not advertised on the radio, television or newspaper for the general public to find and join. And for those who take advantage of these auctions they are just fine with you not being a part of the action.    Auto Auctions App Features:  * Automatic information regarding car auction  * Directions to the nearest auctions location * Helps you view auction cars picture and inventory online * A good way to buy a used car! * Search used auction cars in your region * Car Auctions Online bidding * Bid on vans, trucks, SUVs, and other vehicles such as Nissan, Hyundai, Honda, Ford, Kia, Chevy, BMW, Toyota, Mazda, Mercedes and more  This is a convenient option to purchase cars from places like Cars.com or Auto Trader --- There are over hundreds of cars in one location.

The process is pretty easy on just one page and no previous sign-up is required. The only requisite is one photo of the car and your ad will be automatically approved. Dealerships are welcome.  <b>CAR FINDERS</b> <i>What you need to know before using the app</i>  <b>Real cheap cars?</b> 1st thing you need to know is that the app doesn’t do miracles. If you’re searching for used cars in ""like-new"" condition for $5000 or less and 1-3 years old, this isn’t the app to find them.  App's purpose is to help users to find used cars from $500 up to $5000, which is our range for cheap cars but please, keep in mind that some cars at these prices may need some work, have normal wear, or have high mileage, even though, we can assure that, according to their sellers, many of them run well and for some buyers, that’s enough.  Also, although the app encourages sellers to post cars for sale in this price range, it isn't mandatory or forced. Keep also in mind that CHEAP is an ambiguous/subjective word that relies on the budget and overall condition of the car, having the last word, a personal test drive and the inspection, things that the app hasn’t a way to do by itself.  APP requests sellers to post as much as they can detailed information about the overall condition of cars so buyers may have an idea if it is worth the price or not, but again, a personal test drive will have the last word. ** Never pay money for a car you haven’t tested/checked by yourself first **. You can also always contact the seller to request more information which is the correct way to start the negotiation.  <b>Low inventory</b>.  App isn’t Silicon Valley-funded and the service is totally FREE, so the budget to market it across the country is limited. Some users complain about the low inventory and we understand and apologize about it, so please, give it some time, we're trying as much as we can to make it known and discoverable. App doesn’t use automatic data feeds provided by street dealerships and their marketing networks which is the way bigger car finder apps work to provide millions of listings. Cheap Cars Finder App relies more on cars posted by their owners, at lower or cheaper prices than dealers may not be able to offer.   Just give it a try, if you find something you like, awesome! but if you don’t, you can try another site/app, that’s how searching online works. Whining, retaliating, or leaving a harmful review, doesn’t help at all.  <b>Outdated ads</b>. A common issue among sellers is they forget to remove their cars once they’re sold given that app allows listing them for unlimited time (some fixer-upper cars need more than the usual time to get sold), so that’s why we do really appreciate you use the <b>[REPORT AD]</b> option in case you find a sold car instead of leaving a negative review. Reporting helps more.  <b>APP FEATURES</b>  ♣ Find cheap cars by zip code (distance), make & model, body style, USA state, or price range ♣ Post and manage multiple used cars on the same account ♣ Sort search results by distance, price, year, mileage, model, etc ♣ Receive instant notifications sent by possible buyers ♣ Dark layout good for your eyes and phone battery life ♣ Expandable images (zoom-in-out) ♣ Seller tools to check stats, edit profile, remove/edit ads, etc ♣ Share best deals with friends  Autopten.com © 2007-2022 https://www.autopten.com  Objective and constructive reviews are welcome and appreciated.

Need to sell or trade-in your car, or buy-out your lease? Buying cars at a good price in a crazy market is hard! Let CoPilot help.  CoPilot takes the stress out of shopping for new or used cars: no tricks or bait-and-switch, just honest advice and expert insights so you can buy with confidence. Unlike most car apps, we’re independent and always 100% free. Compare CoPilot to leading car search websites like Cars.com, CARFAX, CarMax, Carvana, KBB (Kelly Blue Book), Edmunds, CarGurus, TrueCar, or Autotrader. CoPilot provides curated results to save you time and money. No endless scrolling. You might call us car shopping / car buying gurus; we only show you cars in stock nearby that match your needs, and tell you which is the best buy.  We compare new and pre-owned cars for sale at every US dealer 24/7 to find hidden gems (premium feature-loaded cars you won’t find anywhere else) at great prices. Like Kayak, but for cars.

We show you the SUV, crossover, wagon, sedan, minivan, convertible, coupe, van or truck to match your preferences (but not caravans, RVs, or bikes). From Audi to Subaru or Toyota; BMW, Chevrolet or Chrysler to Honda to Tesla, our car ratings and dealer reviews tell you what, where, and when to buy, or why you should wait. Dealer-paid apps never do that.  Frustrated by high gas prices, inflation and rising interest rates, flashy websites and pushy dealers? CoPilot's free app delivers unbiased advice, tips and reviews.
