If suspicious spyware is detected on a user's smartphone in Paris, the meta-information is subjected to in-depth analysis in the AI Cloud. If the malware becomes a new threat, all global users are immediately ""vaccinated"" against it. And all this without having to carry out a single product update.  The more you use Antivirus AI, the better the detection and the higher the overall protection of all users worldwide.  <b>Combining strengths</b> Conventional antivirus scanners use a signature-based model, so the scanner knows what the malware looks like. Today, however, malware is changing its behavior to evade detection by traditional technologies.  Antivirus AI uses artificial intelligence and constantly learns about various threats to protect you proactively against malware. The AI scanning engine sits in the background and detects threats immediately, unlike other antivirus apps that constantly look for threats.  <b>Protection against State Trojans</b> Antivirus AI has such a high level of protection that it can even detect unwanted Trojans from government organizations.  Of our more than 5 million Android users (as of November 2022), we have 28,458 detections of such APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats) registered, which government organizations and law enforcement agencies widely use. This is, despite most of these users primarily using well-known antivirus apps as their primary solution.  Antivirus AI achieves this thanks to self-learning algorithms for pattern recognition.   <b>Stops infections: Malware Vaccinations</b> Traditional antivirus scanners update themselves with old-fashioned, static signature updates to detect new malware.  In human medicine, one learns that proactive protection must be dynamic to protect against the ever-increasing danger of new pathogens. The same principle is required today for computers and mobile devices. At Protectstar, for example, we develop vaccinations against malware, which use pattern recognition to protect against new and unknown malware dynamically.  At the same time, vaccinations reliably detect modifications of malware strains. This not only increases the immunity status but, at the same time, reduces energy consumption to work more efficiently.   <b>The ideal combination</b> Protectstar™ Antivirus AI does what antivirus scanners and conventional protection apps cannot and always protect you optimally.  But we also understand that you want to continue to use your tested antivirus scanner app. For this reason, you can also use Antivirus AI as the perfect complement to your existing antivirus solution."
