It's a very simple no fuss gym tracker. It has all these small features that I keep discovering that keeps me thinking how well it's built. The main features I am extremely thankful for are the ""View last time"" feature per exercise that you can go back in the history quickly and the small little ""Easy, med and hard"" color tags you can tag each set with. There are a bunch of others that the dev did right, thanks so much. I can see there's a lot of thought that went into this and it wasn't just built to build an app! Well done!"" - Bernhard Smuts • ""This app is phenomenal. The design descions and features are all super intuitive and cater to weightlifting perfectly. One of my favourite things is the way the app handles adding exercises and sets. You can add sets from a preset workout or one by one, and adding custom exercises is a breeze. Every time you add an exercise it prepopulates the sets from your last exercise and there is a quick look button that shows how heavy you went last time you did the exercise. I cannot recommend it enough."" - Sam Mete • ""I was about to lose my mind trying to find an intuitive, straightforward app to track my workouts. I finally stopped the search with this app. It didn't take long to add previous workouts, and it's so convenient for logging new workouts as well."" - Tara Gordon  <b>Contact us</b> We will be happy to hear your questions and feature suggestions on kotssl@yandex.ru"

The mixing of static and dynamic planks really helps you <b>burn fat fast</b>. Take only 7 minutes a day to burn calories and get in better shape!  With 3 difficulty levels, the 30-day weight loss plan perfectly fits all fitness levels, and it suits both men and women. You can customize your training plan according to your own preferences. There's no equipment or gym needed; you can do plank workouts anywhere at anytime.  <b>Why plank workout?</b> Planks are the most popular and effective fat burning exercise. They can be easily performed and activate all your muscles, including your core, shoulders, glutes, etc. Planks are the best choice for people with weak knees because they put no pressure on knees.  <b>Maximize the belly fat burning:</b> Planks are more effective than crunches at burning belly fat. Planks activate 100% of your abs, while crunches only involve 64% of them.  <b>Strengthen your core:</b> Plank workout fires up all your core muscle groups, enhances your core strength, and helps you get a strong core.  <b>Reduce back pain:</b> Plank workout can strengthen your back muscles, reduce back pain and lower the risk of back and spinal column injuries.  <b>Improve your posture & balance:</b> Plank workout requires your head, back and feet to be in a straight line. Regularly doing this will improve your balance and posture when sitting and standing.  <b>Accelerate your metabolism:</b> Doing planks keeps your metabolism high for the whole day; this dramatically boosts the fat burning process.  <b>Improve your flexibility:</b> Plank workout stretches all your posterior muscle groups, such as your shoulder blades, glutes and hamstrings, thus improving your flexibility and lowering the risk of injury.  <b>Features:</b> - Different forms of planks provided - Customized workout reminders help you make planking a daily workout routine - Detailed instruction, animation, and video guide you through every workout - Workout duration and difficulty increase step by step - Track your weight loss progress automatically - Track your burned calories automatically"
