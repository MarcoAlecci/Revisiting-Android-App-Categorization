We were used to blackberry email and we wanted something like that here. We did not find anything, so we wrote our own. Give our app a try and once you see all the features it has, I promise you won't be disappointed. You can always email us and we will reply right away with help (even on weekends! Yes, we love our users!).   How is MailDroid different? For starters, it is a pure email client which means we don't have a back-end server looking at your mail. You set up your POP, IMAP, Exchange connections and the client speaks directly to the server. Second, it is powerful and yet easy to use. If you don't want to use the PGP or sMIME encryption, simply hide it. Want to use the old navigation over the new navigation drawer, your choice. Want to snooze your email or send it at a delayed time, you can do that as well! Third, we have oAuth2 to Gmail, Yahoo Mail, AOL Mail, and Outlook. oAuth2 means that the app just gets a token from those providers and does not see any password. For those of you who have had issues recently with these providers (specifically Gmail and Yahoo Mail), this is the solution! We worked with all these providers to make sure you feel super secure. Fourth, we have integrated with important and helpful third party email companies like SaneBox! Finally, we support our users! We email you back when you ask for help!!   You are our users and we have built this mail client around feedback from users. We have no agenda of what we need to add anymore, just what people want us to add. We support so many email providers automatically and for those that we can't figure out the settings for, a manual option always exists. We have added support for so many features, that many times we even forget some of the things we have added. Here is a short list:   1. Complete re-write and not based at all on the standard email application 2. Idle Push for all IMAP servers that support it 3. Download attachments to your device using any file explorer or use the built in file manager to manage your files 4. Settings Support for signature, font size, ring tone, led color, icon selection etc. 5. Custom Mail Rules 6. Spell Check 7. Search your mail online (for IMAP servers only) or offline for both IMAP and POP3 servers 8. Password Protection 9. Microsoft Exchange 2003,2007,2010, Office 365 servers 10. Full WYSIWYG editor 11. Split screen for tablets 12. Calendar integration using ICS attachment (exchange 2007/2010 and CalDav support is coming) 13. Cloud storage integration to save attachments (dropbox, box.net, Google drive and SkyDrive/OneDrive) 14. Customize your inbox styles and themes to your preference 15. Spam Filter Plugin --> REQUIRES IN-APP PAYMENT 16. Email Threaded Mode 17. Light Flow, Tesla Unread, Apex Launcher, and Dashclock Integration 18. Different notification styles and icons 19.

S/MIME support for all email providers 23. oAuth2 support for Gmail, Hotmail/Outlook, Yahoo, and AOL Mail 24. Support for SaneBox 25. Much more....  OK, that was a long list, but at least we left it with Much more... instead of going on. So why are you wasting time reading any more, just download the app and mail will finally work again for you!

Even though we focus on the best cryptographic experience in the Android email world, we try to provide a full functioning mail client with corresponding safety features in general.  Since version 2.50.295 R2Mail2 is free to use and does not require a license app for full functionality.  Features: * E-Mail Server: IMAP (incl. pushmail/idle), POP, SMTP and Exchange (>2007 SP1) * SSL with X-509 client certifiate authentication * An database in which the mails are stored encrypted * Special Attachment View (browse your attachments without checking single mails) * Unified Inbox and E-Mail Threading * Peak Options for check intervals * Search Function for messages per Folder * IMAP shared folders  Main Cryptographic Features: * Private keys and passwords are stored in an encrypted database (Key-Store) and protected by a Master Password. * The security settings allow the configuration of encryption parameters, signature and certificate validation methods (OCSP and LDAP). * Full S/MIME and PGP Plain and PGP MIME support * Automatic selection of S/MIME or PGP for each recipient * Full support of Android Root Store * Certificate import of .crt, .pem and .asc formats * Certificate/Key import from KeyServer LDAP or HKP (HTTP)  The application needs the following Android permissions to run: * Full Internet Access - required to send and receive emails * Modify/Delete SD card content - required to access the private key store, download attachments and to write log-files * Read Contacts - required to suggest email addresses from your contacts * Network State - required to check if an Internet connection is present * Vibrate ‚Äì required for notification purposes * WakeLock - to allow service to check mails in background  PLEASE DO NOT REPORT ERRORS IN COMMENTS! We cannot react on that! If you get errors please use ""Menu -> Report Error"" on the start-screen to send us the log-file information in your preferred way!  Informations about Private Key and Validity Handling: The application comes without a personal key pair (the users private and public key) - so it is fully functioning in the sense of sending and receiving emails as any other mail client and provides the correct usage of validation if the mail you receive is signed by the sender. For signing or encrypting a message it is necessary to use a private key you own. Turn to a Trust Center of your choice as a source of supply. You can find a list of trust centers, which are trusted within the Android world, in the Certificate Store (CA section) of R2Mail2. Please be aware that this app can only support Soft-Token in form of P12-files and will not work with smartcard-based certificates.  For more information visit http://r2mail2.com"

HEY‚Äôs fresh approach transforms email into something you want to use, not something you‚Äôre forced to deal with.  <b>It‚Äôs ‚Äúyou‚Äôll never go back‚Äù better</b> HEY replaces workarounds, messy hacks, and daily frustrations, with built-in workflows, effortless organization, and clever features that levels-up email in meaningful ways.  <b>Screen emails like you screen calls</b> You screen your calls, so why can‚Äôt you screen your emails? With HEY, you can. HEY puts you in complete control of who‚Äôs allowed to email you. The first time someone emails you, you get to decide if you want to hear from them again.  <b>The Imbox: It‚Äôs not a typo</b> Everyone hates their bloated inbox, so HEY has a focused Imbox instead. Your Imbox is where important, immediate emails go from people or services you care about. No random receipts, no ‚ÄúI rarely read these‚Äù newsletters, and no special offers crowding out the stuff you really care about.  <b>Blocking email spies 24/7/365</b> Many companies track which emails you open, how often you open them, and even where you were when you opened them. It‚Äôs a massive invasion of your privacy. HEY blocks these trackers and tells you who‚Äôs spying on you.  <b>Add private ‚Äúnotes to self‚Äù to any email thread</b> Conversations may start in email, but they may continue somewhere else. Some emails turn into lunches or calls or video conferences. Where do you put the notes from those - especially if they relate to the initial email conversation? With HEY, you can add personal, private notes (and files) to any thread. This way you keep everything related to the conversation on one page, even if it didn‚Äôt all happen via email.  <b>Put receipts in The Paper Trail</b> Receipts, confirmations, and transactional emails getting in your way? With HEY, you can send those types of emails to The Paper Trail where they‚Äôll be out of your way, but easy to find when you need them.  <b>A built-in ‚ÄúReply Later‚Äù workflow</b> What if you need to reply, but you don‚Äôt have time right now? With HEY, just click the ‚ÄúReply Later‚Äù button to move an email to a dedicated ‚ÄòReply Later‚Äô pile at the bottom of the screen so you don‚Äôt lose or forget it.  <b>Just set it aside</b> Sometimes you get emails you need to reference later - travel info, handy links, numbers you need, etc. With HEY, you can ‚ÄòSet Aside‚Äô any email in a neat little pile for easy access whenever you need it. At hand, but out of your face.  <b>You always pay for email</b> ‚ÄúFree‚Äù email like other providers isn‚Äôt free ‚Äî you pay by giving up your privacy and valuable personal data.
