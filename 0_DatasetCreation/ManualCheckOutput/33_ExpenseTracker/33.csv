Personal finance is made simple by smart algorithms, which means budgeting with PocketGuard is so easy that you don't have to spend your entire life crunching numbers. We take care of all the routines like expense tracking and bill monitoring so you can clearly focus on money management operations.  Always know what's in your pocket! Basically, a budget is a difference between income and expenses. If it's positive - you're doing well. In any other case, the budget is unbalanced and needs attention. This is where the ""IN MY POCKET"" feature takes action. How much disposable income do you have after paying your bills, saving for your goals, and setting aside enough money for needs and wants? PocketGuard budgeting app does those calculations for you! Always know the actual safe-to-spend amount so you can fit your monthly budget.    Comprehensive analytics! Budget and expense tracking are just a part of the story. If you wanna do money management the right way you need to learn from the data you track. PocketGuard's free budgeting app provides you with various reports to let you see personal finances from different angles. Learn about your spending habits, make necessary adjustments, and optimize your monthly budget.  Bill tracker and subscription manager! You can use PocketGuard as a bill organizer. Once you connect bank accounts the app starts working as a finance tracker. All your bills and subscriptions will be identified automatically and included in your monthly budget. The bill organizer will help you never miss the due date again.  Do you want to lower your bills? PocketGuard bill organizer gives you an easy way to negotiate better rates with your provider. So you can optimize your budget by cutting costs on services you use. PocketGuard subscription manager will help you to find subscriptions you might have forgotten about. This is another money management trick - stop paying for services you no longer need.    Set and reach your financial goals! Goals are a key concept of budgeting. Expense tracking is just a part of the story. Personal finance is made of goals. Let's say you want to spend less on shopping or save more for vacation. These are financial goals. The PocketGuard budget app gives you all the necessary tools to set them properly.  Set up your debt-payoff plan! Nobody's perfect and almost anyone has debt to pay off. The question is: do you have a plan? Connect all your credit and loan accounts and we'll show you the way to a debt-free future. Our smart algorithm calculates the most profitable debt repayment strategy so you'll save hundreds or even thousands by paying less in interest!
