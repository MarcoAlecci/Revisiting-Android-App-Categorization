Make sure that you have activated ""Use on the move"" in the settings. To change the settings, you must be connected to the Wi-Fi of your FRITZ!Box.  Some Internet service providers (increasingly cable providers) provide connections where remote access from the Internet to the connection at home is not possible or only possible with restrictions because no public IPv4 address is provided. The FRITZ!App Smart Home usually detects such connections automatically and displays a corresponding message. Such connection types are called ""DS-Lite"", ""Dual-Stack-Lite"" or ""Carrier Grade NAT"" (CGN). If necessary, you can ask your provider whether there is an option to obtain a public IPv4 address."

Ruuvi Station collects and visualises Ruuvi sensor data, such as temperature, relative air humidity, air pressure and movement from local Bluetooth Ruuvi sensors and Ruuvi Cloud. Additionally, Ruuvi Station allows you to manage your Ruuvi devices, set alerts, change background photos, and visualise the gathered sensor information through graphs.    How does it work?  Ruuvi sensors send tiny messages over Bluetooth, which can then be picked up by nearby mobile phones or specialised Ruuvi Gateway routers. Ruuvi Station mobile app enables you to collect and visualise this data on your mobile device. Ruuvi Gateway, on the other hand, routes the data over the internet not only to the mobile application but also to the browser application.  Ruuvi Gateway routes the sensor measurement data directly to the Ruuvi Cloud cloud service, which enables you to build a complete remote monitoring solution including remote alerts, sensor sharing and history in Ruuvi Cloud – all available within the Ruuvi Station app! Ruuvi Cloud users can view longer measurement history by using the browser application.  Use our customisable Ruuvi mobile widgets alongside the Ruuvi Station app when data is fetched from Ruuvi Cloud to view selected sensor data at a glance.   Above features are available to you if you are a Ruuvi Gateway owner or have received a shared sensor to your free Ruuvi Cloud account.

These instructions are known as code, and computer programmers write code to solve problems or perform a task. The end goal is to create something: that could mean anything from a web page, or a  piece of software, or even just a pretty picture. That’s why computer programming is often described  as a mix between art and science; it’s technical and analytical, yet creative at the same time   ‎😃 internet of things (IoT)  The internet of things, or IoT, is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines,  objects, animals, or people that are provided with unique identifiers (UIDs) and the ability to transfer data over  a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.
