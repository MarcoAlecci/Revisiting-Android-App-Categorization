Draw, illustrate, sketch, doodle, or scribble - the choice is up to you.   The app is extremely lightweight, at a download size of just 5 MB.    SketchPad aims to provide a simple way to turn your screen into a canvas without any hassle. Unlike most other drawing apps, SketchPad keeps it clean. It's just a canvas and you.   You can get started on your Sketch pretty much straightaway after the app is installed. No setup required. It's really that simple.    <b>Features:</b> • Simple UI • No ADs • No In-App Purchases • Customizable Brush Width with Instant Preview, for those bold strokes and fine details • Multiple ways to pick colors: Palette, Spectrum, and RGB Sliders • Unlimited Undo/Redo, because it's okay to make mistakes (still limited by device capabilities) • Optional Shake to Clear feature - just shake your device to clear the Canvas (requires accelerometer) • Export as PNG or JPEG image • Directly share image from SketchPad (automatically exports image to device)    ""Shake to Clear"" is good for when there are no sudden movements, so don't use it in the bus for serious Sketching. However, it is great when scribbling to pass the time.   SketchPad is capable of working offline. However, sharing your Sketches with others might not work without a network connection. The Storage permission is required only to save your Sketches to your device. I do <b>not</b> steal your precious files.   Exported images are saved to ""/Pictures/SketchPad/"" by default. The Storage path can be changed to a directory of your choice in Settings to suit your needs. Saving Sketches to ""/DCIM/Camera/"" should make the images show up in most Gallery apps. On Android 10 onwards, due to changes in how storage works, all pictures are saved to ""/Android/data/com.kanishka_developer.SketchPad/files/Pictures"", irrespective of the setting.   The focus of the SketchPad Project has always been on the User Experience.
