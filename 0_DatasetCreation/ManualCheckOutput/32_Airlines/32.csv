Profile of Aircrafts used in NAC services.  Douglas DC-3 Dakota 28-seater Dakota, NAC‘s very first aircraft, has become an icon of Nepal‘s aviation history. In many parts of the Kingdom, the people‘s initial encounter with the modern world was the DC-3, long before the cars got here. The last of these planes flew into the sunset in 1973.  Fong Shu Harvester AN-2 This 12-seater Chinese plane joined the fleet in 1963. Nepal Airlines had two of them which were in service for a brief period. They flew on domestic route till 1965.  Pilatus Porter PC-6 This single-engine air craft entered service in 1961. Manufactured in Switzerland, it seated six persons. The plane proved extremely suitable for Nepal‘s mountainous terrain where STOL capability was put to full use. NAC was flying one till 1998.  Fokker Friendship F-27 The Fokker launched Nepal into the turboprop era. In operation from 1966 to 1970, it carried 44 passengers and flew to NAC‘s international destinations. A lot of prestige was attached to traveling in a Fokker in those days.  Hawker Siddley HS-748 Avro Nepal Airlines obtained its first Avro in 1970. The 44-seater planes were utilized on domestic and international sectors. The immensely popular sight-seeing excursion -the Mountain Flight -were also conducted by Avros.  Twin Otter DHC-6 The arrival of the Twin Otter was another turning point in the Kingdom‘s aviation scenario. Brought into service in 1971, this 19-seater Canadian plane was instrumental in opening up the mountainous interior. It could land and take off from small and rough airstrips. And suddenly, far-flung villages and remote trail-heads were only minutes away.  Boeing 727 The nation became the proud possessor of a jet plane carrier with the induction of a Boeing 727 in 1972. People would rush to their roof -tops to watch in awe as the sleek craft came in screaming from beyond the hills. Carrying 123 passengers, it connected Kathmandu with regional destinations and remained in service till 1993.  Boeing 757 The first of Nepal Airlines‘ two 757s arrived in 1987. Flying on long-haul routes and displaying the national flag at world airports, they helped Nepal make its presence felt in the international aviation scene. The 757 holds 190 passengers.  Modern Ark 60 (MA60) Turbo prop powered Chinese Aircraft "" Modern Ark 60 "" is better known as MA60. It's a 56 seat aircraft for domestic trunk routes operation. It landed in Kathmandu on April 2014.  Y12E This is a 17- seater twin engine turbo prop Aircraft with STOL (Short Take Off and Landing) capacity received from China similar flying capability as a Twin Otter DHC6-300. The first of the Y12 E landed on Kathmandu on November 2014.  Airbus A320 The most awarded Aircraft in the history of Nepalese Aviation, Airbus A320-200, a 158 passenger seat( 8 business class and 150 economy class) landed in TIA on February 2015 amongst a huge fanfare.  Airbus A330-200 Currently Nepal Airlines is running 2 Airbus A330-200 viz: Airbus A330-200 -9N ALY known as Annapurna and Airbus A330-200 -9N ALZ known as Makalu. It is a 274 seated aircraft with 256 Economy class and 18 Business class."

In 2019, AWA also received an award from Embraer in recognition of reliability in data quality, and were inducted into the CIMG Hall of Fame after being voted as “Best Domestic Airline” for 5 consecutive years.
