At Spotted by Locals, we are committed to reducing these impacts and encouraging sustainable travel. By providing travellers with insider knowledge and encouraging them to explore lesser-known areas, we can help distribute tourism more evenly and support local businesses and communities. How do we do that?  - Responsible: writers (Spotters) are locals who live in the city, speak the local language and love their city. Spotters are not allowed to write about obvious tourist spots and international franchises. This increases the chance that the travel budget ends up with the local entrepreneur.  - Personal: Spotters are presented with their real names, social media channels, pictures, and motivation.  So why stick to the usual tourist itineraries when you can experience a city like a local? With our app, you'll have access to local curated recommendations, helping you avoid crowded tourist spots and discover hidden gems that make each city unique. Whether you're looking for the best local restaurants, hidden parks, or off-the-beaten-path museums, Spotted by Locals has you covered.  So why wait?

Use our smart filters to sort places based on distance and Rating.</blockquote>  ✔️<b>Accommodation</b> : If you visit Goa Tourism in the non-peak season i.e. March to October, you will find really good accommodation at a highly affordable price. Good hotels within a 1km radius of popular beaches like Colva and Calangute will charge you around 2000-2500 per room (double bed). With a little negotiation, you can get an extra mattress in the room to make it triple sharing. Cost: 800/person/day = 2400 (for the 3 day stay)  ✔️<b>Transport</b> : The cheapest way to goa travel and explore Goa is to rent bikes – taxis are exorbitantly priced (Rs 25/km) and bus network is almost non-existent. Bikes will cost you anywhere from 350-600 per day depending on the bike that you want (350 for the Activa, 500 for Pulsar, 600 for Avenger etc). Fuel cost is over and above that. Cost: Around 500/day for 2 people = 750 per person (for the 3 day trip)  ✔️<b>Food </b>: Do not go for the expensive shacks and restaurants all the time. You can find plenty of good restaurants just outside the beaches. Should not cost more than 300 per meal i.e. 600 per day. Booze is as cheap as it gets  <b>Places that one should visit in Goa 👍</b>  <b>North Goa Tourism </b> 👉Sinquerim Beach or Aguada Beach/Fort 👉Baga Beach for Clubbing and evening sunset dinner on a beach 👉Calangute Beach for Water Sports Parasailing and Sandy Pleasures 👉Goa State Museum is the state’s archaeology museum 👉Chapora Fort and Backwaters of Chapora River 👉Anjuna Beach Flea Market on Wed 👉Mapusa market on Sat 👉Arambol Beach home to hippie 👉Vagator Beach  👉Mandrem Beach 👉Anjuna Beach 👉Candolim Beach: 👉The Church of Mae De Deus 👉Reis Magos Fort 👉Ashwem Beach 👉St. Alex Church 👉Morjim Beach (Morjim) 👉The Saturday Night Market (Arpora) only in Season 👉Keri Beach (Querim Beach) (Arambol)  <b>South Goa Tourism </b> 👉Hollant Beach 👉Benaulim Beach 👉Velsao Beach 👉Patnem Beach 👉Betul Beach 👉Cavelossim Beach 👉Mobor Beach 👉Kakolem Beach 👉Polem Beach 👉Agonda Beach Rock Formations (Agonda) 👉Varca Beach 👉Galgibaga Beach 👉Talpona Beach 👉Colva Beach 👉Cansaulim Beach 👉Butterfly Beach 👉Betalbatim Beach 👉Majorda Beach 👉Bogmalo Beach 👉Palolem Beach 👉Se Cathedral, Basilica of Bom Jesus, 👉Shantadurga Temple 👉Margao Market 👉Church of Holy Spirit (Margao) 👉Se Cathedral 👉Naval Aviation Museum 👉St Xavier’s Church 👉Cabo De Rama  <b>Expected Expenses for goa trip per person (prices may vary):</b> ✔️Accommodation near Baga - 1600 (would cost much more near Dec.) ✔️Bike Rent - 400 ✔️Food - 4000 (Non-Veg) 2000 (Veg) ✔️Casino - 2000 ✔️Club - 2000 ✔️Water Sports - 500 ✔️Drinks - 1000 (Applicable If you drink) 👍Total Cost – 10k approx.  🚩Instagram: <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fgoa.app&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3m4TuY52ukRXEZuYovfhf-"">https://www.instagram.com/goa.app</a> 🚩Facebook: <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fgoaapp%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0mA9roHummNHneIrUB59fb"">https://www.facebook.com/goaapp</a> 🚩Twitter: <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fgoaapp&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3-Bv1MUPMoh58rwiLgZIrJ"">https://twitter.com/goaapp</a> 🚩Linkedin: <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fcompany%2Fgoaapp&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw04aZ6dpVFP7YVRcoBhQ9CL"">https://www.linkedin.com/company/goaapp</a>  Got questions?
