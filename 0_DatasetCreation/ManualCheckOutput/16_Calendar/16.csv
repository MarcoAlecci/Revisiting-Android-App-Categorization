Improving your daily routine.  This is what you can achieve with TimeTune, your time blocking and schedule planner.  <b>WHAT IS TIMETUNE?</b>  TimeTune is a time blocking and daily planner application. We designed it to help you make better use of your time, increase your productivity and achieve your goals.  Have you ever wondered why some people can get plenty of things done in a single day while your time slips through your fingers?  The answer is that they have a very organized distribution of time. They know time is a precious resource and they have strong time management habits. That’s what allows them to focus, seize the day and do everything in their agenda.  With TimeTune you can do the same.  <b>HOW DOES IT WORK?</b>  TimeTune uses time blocks to build your schedule. Just add time blocks to your day or use time blocks to build templates that can be reused at any time, like a morning routine, a full day template or a timetable.  The template calendar feature allows you to plan your upcoming schedule, routines, timetables or shift work calendar automatically.  TimeTune will show you automatic statistics that will uncover where the time goes and where you can improve.  Also, you can add custom reminders to your time blocks, so you don’t forget about your agenda: reminders with custom vibrations, reminders with custom sounds, voice reminders, etc.  With TimeTune you can create a time management system as simple or as complex as you need, including statistics. This time blocking and daily schedule planner will allow you to reach your goals and is the perfect complement to your calendar.  <b>WHY DOES IT WORK?</b>  Time blocking is a scheduling method that divides your day into smaller segments of time for specific tasks. When you add statistics to the formula, you get the perfect system to optimize your productivity and become a master of your time.  Time blocking allows you to focus on the task at hand, avoiding distractions and procrastination. It has been proven to increase focus, motivation and productivity.  As Cal Newport, author of “Deep Work” and assistant professor of computer science at Georgetown University states:  “Time blocking generates a massive amount of productivity. A 40-hour time-blocked work week produces the same amount of output as a 60+ hour work week without structure.”  It’s no wonder high achievers like Benjamin Franklin, Elon Musk, Bill Gates and many others embraced this planning method.  Also, for people with ADHD, time blocking might be the best single approach to tackle their tasks and avoid anxiety. If you have ADHD, TimeTune allows you to plan your day, focus on your tasks, improve your daily routine and see where the time went.  <b>WHAT CAN I DO WITH TIMETUNE?</b>  With TimeTune you can:  ★ Increase your focus, motivation and productivity. ★ Do everything in your agenda and accomplish your goals. ★ Improve your time management habits. ★ Schedule your morning routine or daily routine with templates. ★ Set timetables or student calendars with templates. ★ Set your shift work calendar with templates. ★ Use the app as your daily planner, weekly planner or routine planner. ★ Declutter your calendar by removing routine tasks from it. ★ Analyze your time with statistics. ★ Use custom reminders for additional motivation. ★ Free up time for yourself and your family. ★ Organize your life and achieve a better work/life balance. ★ Avoid anxiety and burnout. ★ Get things done if you have ADHD.  <b>WHO IS IT FOR?</b>  If you would like to do more things with your time and achieve your goals, TimeTune is for you.  Additionally, many users with ADHD tell us that TimeTune helps them a lot with their schedule and they use the app as their ADHD and routine planner. So if you have ADHD, give TimeTune a try and let us know what you think.

By convention, the day is the smallest unit of time; the measurement of fractions of a day is classified as time measurement. The generality of this definition is due to the diverse methods used to compile calendars. Although some calendars repeat astronomical cycles according to fixed rules, others are based on abstract, constantly repeating cycles of no astronomical significance. Some calendars are regulated by astronomical observations, some contain each unit accurately and redundantly, and some contain ambiguities and discontinuities. Some calendars are codified in written laws; others are transmitted through oral tradition.  The common theme of making calendars is the desire to organize time units to meet the needs and businesses of society. In addition to practical purposes, the organizational process offers a sense, how illusory, also the understanding of and time itself. Calendars thus serve as a link between humanity and the cosmos. It is no wonder that calendars held a sacred status and served as a source of social order and cultural identity. Calendars provided the basis for planning agricultural, hunting and migration cycles, for divination and prediction, and for maintaining cycles of religious and civil events. Regardless of their scientific refinement, calendars should ultimately be judged as social contracts, not as scientific treatises.  According to a recent estimate (Fraser, 1987), about forty calendars are used in the world today. This chapter is limited to the half dozen major calendars currently in use. Furthermore, the emphasis in the chapter is on function and calculation rather than on culture. The basic basis of the calendars is given, along with brief historical summaries. Although algorithms are given to correlate these systems, it appears carefully that even the standard calendars are subject to local variation. With the exception of the Julian calendar, this chapter does not deal with extinct systems. The inclusion of the Julian calendar is justified by its everyday use in historical studies.  Despite a large literature on calendars, it is difficult to find truly authoritative references, especially in English. Aveni (1989) examines a wide range of calendar systems and emphasizes their cultural contexts rather than their operational details. Paris (1982) contains useful but not infallible tables for converting the date. Fotheringham (1935) and the Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics (1910), in its section on ""Calendars"", provide basic information on historical calendars. The sections on ""Calendars"" and ""Chronology"" in all editions of the Encyclopedia Britannica provide useful historical recordings. Ginzel (1906) remains an authoritative, if dated, standard of calendar science. References to individual calendars are given in the relevant sections."

OneView Calendar doesn't have a day view, week view, month view, year view or  an agenda view instead it replaces all of these views  with one single view giving you a perfect overview and total control.  <b>Features:</b> • Zooming with your fingers to see anything from decades to minutes. • Scroll quickly by swiping up and down on the screen. • Advanced mathamatics positions your events perfectly so that everthing looks clear whatever period of time you are looking at. • Add events by dragging and dropping directly on the calendar. • Simultaneously show or switch between multiple calendars, private or shared. Makes it a perfect calendar for couples and families. • A web version exists enabling you to quickly access your calendar from any device.   OneView Calendar shows you your meetings and events on, what we call, a proportional timeline. A timeline is the clearest and most natural way of showing events in time. We've seen it in ancient history books as well as on Facebook and it's a great way to get a good overview. Most calendars use month views, week views and day views, which show time as a grids and pages and not as a timeline. The agenda view, on the other hand, is a timeline. All of the days and their events line up one after the other. The agenda view may be a timeline, but it isn't proportional since some days might be missing and some days might be much bigger than others. OneView calendar is a proportional timeline in the sense that every day is there and every day is the same size and a week seven times bigger than a day and so on. This is important because it helps you get a proper feel for the things you have planned ahead and how much space there is between each planned event. To make things even better OneView Calendar is an infinetly zoomable and proportional timeline. Enabling you to quickly look at 2 weeks, 3 months, the summer holiday or even years at once.  All of this adds up to give you a superior calendar overview giving you anything from a 10 year calendar view to a 8, 4 or 2 hour calendar view or what ever period of time you like. This might all sound crazy, but it's so simple and natural that it will make you wonder why all calendars don't work like this. Give it a try.  <b>Web site:</b> http://www.oneviewcalendar.com"
