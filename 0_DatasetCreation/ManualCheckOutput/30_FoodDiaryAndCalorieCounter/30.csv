Everyone has a personalised number of calories/macros they should eat daily based on many factors and their goal.   Based on your data, we will generate your personalised calories and macros allowance and make it super easy to track this and adjust targets inside the app.   IS TRACKING HARD?   We're the only nutrition app that doesn't assume everything tracked is perfectly done or require perfect tracking. In the real world, we can never know the weight and portion size of everything we eat.   Our algorithm has taken this into account, and we will auto-adjust your daily calorie target if you eat less or more the previous day. This allows complete flexibility day to day. You don't need to eat the same amount each day. We focus on your weekly average being near your targets.   What if you're eating out and don't know the exact calories? Simply find the closest food in our huge food database and tap ""guess tracked"". We will take care of the rest.   HOW ARE YOU DIFFERENT TO OTHER FOOD TRACKING APPS?  Turtle is the market's first female optimised, realistic calories and macros tracker.   We're more than a food tracker; that's just one part of our app. We allow you to track your food, menstrual cycle, stress, emotions, sleep, training, steps, weight, measurements and more.   We combine three main areas/data points:   Food Tracker  Menstrual cycle tracker Mental health tracker  To adjust your targets and give you suggestions.   We focus on total health, not just losing weight or food. We help people become stronger, leaner, healthier, happier and more resilient.   THE WEEKLY REVIEW - ACCOUNTABILITY  Other food tracking apps offer no accountability. You track and hope for the best. You also get low-calorie targets that don't consider the impact this has on your mental health and menstrual cycle.   With us, you'll complete a weekly review where the app takes in all your tracked data to decide whether to change your calories and macros targets. It will also offer suggestions for improvement.    Our algorithm has been created from over 30,000 manual weekly check-ins with our members and the wisdom and insight from PhDs in nutrition, world-leading psychotherapists and AI experts.   INTEGRATIONS  Sync with Apple Healthkit, Fitbit, Garmin & Google fit to track your steps and weight seamlessly.

PERSONALIZED:  Our studies show that one-size-fits-all nutrition just doesn't work. So the ZOE program starts with the most comprehensive at-home test available  – analyzing your gut microbiome, blood sugar, and blood fat – to get an accurate picture of your unique biology.  CUTTING EDGE: The impact of food on your metabolism is more complex than just calories in. Which is why we use the latest developments in machine learning and the microbiome to understand how gut microbes influence your health and weight.  NO FOOD OFF LIMITS:  We know most of our members have tried other programs in the past. But members tell us that ZOE feels different. You won't count points, calories or macros here and that can feel really liberating. Instead you'll learn what your own body needs and see that playing with your food is actually pretty fun!  SUPPORTED:  You'll have support and guidance from our ZOE Coaches every step of the way. All our coaches are trained in the ZOE method with a deep understanding of nutrition science. So you're in safe hands.  HOW ZOE WORKS  1. Your body is unique. So we'll start with a comprehensive, easy-to-use, at-home test to understand your biology from all angles – gut microbiome, blood sugar, and blood fat. 2. Our detailed insight reports compare your test results to thousands of other people. Revealing how your body works and which foods will nourish it. 3. You'll then put your insights into action with a personalized program – helping you work towards your health and weight goals with motivating challenges and supporting lessons each week. 4. Finally, make it your own! We know restrictive diets don't work. So with ZOE no food is off limits. You'll use the app to learn how to build great meals and see that with the right combinations your body can have a better response to what you eat and you can avoid dietary inflammation.  FEATURES  - Personalized food recommendations based on your own test results - Motivating challenges to help you nourish your body and gut - 1:1 messaging with coaches to help you reach your health and weight goals - 3-minute reflection exercises to track changes in how your body feels - Quick daily lessons that help you develop healthier habits - Scan a barcode, or browse our food database, to get your personalized analysis for over 1,000,000 foods - Browse hundreds of recipes to find meals that work for you  Please note: To use this app you need to be a ZOE member.

(Hello, bio hackers.)  We say you can do both.   Avatar Nutrition is a total body transformation system that helps you eat for a life you love while gaining total control over your weight and body fat!   We believe healthy eating should be simple, straightforward, sustainable….and include food you actually enjoy.  Be that as it may, would you agree that there’s a lot of confusion about what’s actually “healthy”?  Between nutritional experts debating whether or not we should eat sweet potatoes, regular potatoes, or if we should even be eating them at all…it’s hard to know what to believe.   We’ve seen countless people struggle with their weight and get taken advantage of by people selling diet gimmicks. (We all know the latest fad diet is just that...a fad).   There’s just so much (mis)information to sift through.  That’s why we take a big picture approach to health.   A macro approach.

Since our launch in 2015, we have helped 100,000+ clients lose 2,000,000+ pounds!   The key to our success is showing people what they’d been missing on every other diet they’ve tried.   What few people know is how to eat accurately.  Every person has a unique need for protein, carbs, and fats - the building blocks of all foods we call “macros.”   The Avatar Nutrition system makes it easy for you to understand your unique macro targets based on your goals, ultimately giving you lasting control over your health.  Here’s how it works:  Set a goal Log your food daily > based on feedback > adjusts  Follow the daily macro recommendations Check-in weekly for your new macros adjustments and watch your body transform  The best part about this system is that it is impossible to mess up!  Avatar is designed to nudge your daily intake to keep your weekly average range right where it needs to be for you to make progress. > so you never plateau   So you can go ahead and stop hiding in the pantry while you sneak a bag of chips.

It tracks & measures ALL nutrients important to your health in real-time. This complete, holistic view of your nutrition, combined with Fuelbetter's ground-breaking digital dietitian, empowers you to achieve your dietary, health, and performance goals, whatever they are:  ∙ Lasting weight loss  ∙ Faster exercise recovery & performance  ∙ Pregnancy health  ∙ Shifting to a plant-based diet without losing out on important nutrients  ∙ Immune system support  ∙ & more...  Fuelbetter’s team of software engineers, data scientists, RDs, and sports scientists have spent years developing the proprietary technology that makes the app possible. The end result is revolutionary: FOUR WORLD-FIRST functionalities which can help you take control of your health like never before.  1. PRECISELY CALCULATE YOUR BIOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS Fuelbetter calculates your unique nutrient requirements using techniques normally reserved for elite athletes. The one-size-fits-all RDAs (recommended daily allowances) communicated by public health authorities are relevant to hardly any of us. Not only that, but requirements can shift suddenly during moments of life change, such as pregnancy, taking on a new physical challenge, starting a weight loss journey, or going vegan.  Iron is a great example: A woman following a paleo diet who exercises infrequently may have a dietary iron need of 4mg/day, while another woman of the same height and weight but following a vegan diet and training as an endurance runner may need 100mg/day. That’s a big difference – equivalent to the amount of iron in 3.5kg (8 lbs) of spinach!  2. TEST FOR 164 NUTRIENT DEFICIENCIES/EXCESSES Fuelbetter monitors your nutrient intake throughout the day, compares this to your nutrient requirements, and checks for the presence of any nutritional deficiencies or excesses. Historically, only blood tests could offer this level of insight, at an average cost more than $15/£10 per nutrient. Fuelbetter tests for 164 nutrients in real time, at a fraction of the cost.  3. ON-DEMAND DIGITIAL NUTRITIONIST Once you’ve identified any problem areas in your diet, Fuelbetter’s powerful digital nutritionist suggests exactly what to eat to hit your nutrient requirements. Rather than complicated new recipes and obscure ingredients, you’ll see meal suggestions based on foods you’re already eating. If you don’t like the first suggestion, just swipe left and to get another suggestion instantly.  4. SEE THE HEALTH & CLIMATE IMPACT OF YOUR CHOICES Just in case you need any further motivation, Fuelbetter measures the real time impact of your food choices on your immune health, the health of the planet, and your risk of developing type 2 diabetes and other diet-related non-communicable diseases.

It’s hard to track calorie intake, though, not least because it’s easy to forget everything you eat during a busy day.  Recording your calories as you eat gives you a clearer picture of the calories you are consuming. It also enhances your awareness of food values and nutrient levels, all of which helps you make healthier choices when eating.   🤓 HOW IT WORKS Based on your weight, height and activity level, Calory will calculate a suggested daily calorie goal for you. The daily goal will also factor in if you want to maintain, lose or gain weight.  After you know your daily energy requirements, your challenge is to eat the right number of calories!  Calory, meanwhile, will remind you throughout the day to record your calorie intake.   🤩 GREAT CALORY FEATURES • Quick Value Add - quickly add calories you have consumed - it takes seconds • Create custom Plates for regular food and meals you eat • Daily Calorie Intake Calculator which tells you how many calories you need per day • Macro Tracking - track your macro nutrient goals • Water Tracker - track your daily water intake needs • Keep track of your weight • Widgets - quickly log your favorite plates and see your progress • Daily history snapshot where you can review your logged meals • Weekly, monthly, and yearly progress charts which give a fantastic overview while also helping you make comparisons • Custom Reminders / Notifications to keep you on track • Barcode food UPC scanning (US region only currently) • Multiple theme colors to choose from so you can customize Calory • NO registration or sign up required!
