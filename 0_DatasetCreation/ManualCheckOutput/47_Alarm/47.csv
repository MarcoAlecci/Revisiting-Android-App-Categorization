This app has been designed to be simple to set up but also powerful enough so you can have a smart alarm clock that can do amazing things like recognizing simple objects like toothbrush, shoes, animals, and smiles on a picture so you have to wake to laugh, even by force, or simply solving puzzles like math equations, memory, and sequence games to stop the alarm.  <h1>Features:</h1> ★ <b>Challenges and Games</b> (Math, Memory, Sequence, Retype, Picture, Smile, and Pose) ★ <b>Disable/limit number of snoozes</b> ★ <b>Multiple media</b> (Ringtone, Alarm songs, or music) ★ <b>Dark theme</b> for the app ★ <b>Prevent user from turn off</b> the phone or uninstall the alarm ★ <b>Smooth increase volume</b> ★ <b>Extra loud volume</b>   You can customize this alarm clock anyway you like:  <h2>Adding Challenges</h2> This alarm clock comes with a lot of challenges (like a puzzle, games, taking pictures) that gives you tasks so you can't dismiss the alarm and go back sleep.  You can also add multiples challenges to your alarm. That way, when the alarm starts, random challenges will be assigned to the alarm and you never get bored.  Some of the tasks to the alarm are:  <h3>Picture Challenge</h3> Using some AI stuff, the app can recognize a pre-select list of objects and can't turn off the alarm until you take pictures of pre-chosen objects or animals.  For example, always forget to drink water? Add a challenge to take a picture of a cup when it triggers so when it starts you have to stand up and drink water.  <h3>Smile Challenge</h3> Simple like that, you have to wake up with a big smile, a huge one, and take a selfie. If you don't show all of your teeth to the camera, the alarm will never go out. Jokes book is recommended for this challenge  <h3>Memory Game</h3> The classic memory game. Configure the board with the number of cards you want and, when the alarm starts, match the pairs on the board until you find out all the couples.  <h3>Math Challenge</h3> If you think wake up early is annoying, imagine waking up early having to solve a math problem. Happily, that is the case 😁. Choose between levels of a math problem to solve when the alarm goes off and fry your brain out, trying to find out the correct number.  <h3>Retype Game</h3> The app shows a list of characters at random and you have to write it in the exact order. Seems simple, but try to do that as soon as you wake up and see  <h3>Sequence Game</h3> Complete this puzzle by tapping the shapes at the same order as it shines. Don't worry if you don't remember all at first, the alarm can repeat the sequence as many times you want.  <h3>Pose Challenge</h3> Put the camera in a good place and do some pose, like yoga, to the camera.  <h2>Snooze</h2> Disable snooze or limit it, so you have to complete the challenges, or change the snooze duration to a tiny one, so you don't have any time to rest.  <h2>Vibrate</h2> Don't like your phone vibrating like crazy when waking up? Me neither, that's why you have the option to disable it from the alarm and just listen to the beautiful song.  <h2>Media</h2> Choose between your favorite music, your phone ringtones, or no sound at all to wake up and configure the volume you want the media.  <h2>Soft wake</h2> The media you choose will increase the volume gently until the sound you configured.  <h2>Dark mode</h2> Change the theme of the app between light and dark mode any way you like.  <h2>Smooth increase volume</h2> The volume of the alarm increases gradually until max, so you wake up gracefully  <h2>Extra loud volume</h2> It will override the phone volume, increase it, and lock to its max.  <h2>Annoying mode</h2> This option will not let you uninstall the app or turn off the phone.

It turned out or not - to judge you, dear users. The number of settings will allow you to create a comfortable way to wake up, suitable for you. But if there is no desire to deal with the settings, then just select the right time and days of the week. Large numbers and a power button will be convenient for people with low vision.  In the alarm clock, I added the following functions and features: ⏰ the ability to turn off the alarm by flipping the phone or using the buttons volume (individually adjustable) ⏰ various melodies, the ability to set your own ⏰ the ability to set a pre-signal that will push you to wake up before the main signal ⏰ the ability to alert by vibration. You can lower the volume of the alarm clock, leaving only vibration. Suitable for mothers in order not to wake the baby. ⏰ setting the transfer time and the intervals between snoozes ⏰ gradual increase in signal volume with a choice of increase speed ⏰ A variety of visual themes with the ability to set your own images on the wake-up screen. ⏰adding notes to each alarm ⏰ the ability to adjust the screen brightness when the alarm goes off ⏰set automatic alarm off ⏰various shutdown screens ⏰ desktop widgets for the ability to control existing signals  The combination of all these functions will give you the opportunity to wake up exactly as you want. You can configure both a gentle, soft wake up to a smooth increase in the volume of your favorite song, and an aggressive signal that will make you immediately get out of bed. The ability to turn off in a variety of ways makes it possible to blindly transfer the signal or postpone it (for example, you can set the signal to be delayed by turning the phone down by the screen and completely disabling the alarm by pressing the “volume up” key)    Important note! If suddenly your alarm does not work or is triggered, but not on time, it means that you missed the Welcome screen and did not follow my advice on whitelisting for battery optimization modes on Android 6 and above. Drop the settings of the application or reinstall it, carefully read what I wrote in the welcome message and perform the necessary manipulations. There's nothing to be done, Android is struggling to survive the battery.

Did you perform the necessary manipulations from the recommendations on the start screen? If so, then write me somewhere, we'll sort it out together.  - Alarm clock will work on the phone off? Unfortunately no. The phone must be switched on. The alarm clock works on top of the system. The system is turned off - the program is not running.    - What's in the Deluxe version? How is she better than this? There are no fundamental differences. You can buy it if you want to thank me with a mug of coffee. All themes and options are available in it.

Have you tried various alarm apps but they haven't been up to the mark?  Then you must try Odd Alarm – an alarm mobile app for those who are fed up of their habit of oversleeping and want a solution once and for all. Aside from having the usual clock functions like setting time, timers and counters, for the main alarm function, Odd Alarm allows you to set custom sounds that are really disturbing.  Odd Alarm annoys you out of your sleep, literally.  You can set an assortment of crazy alarm sounds, for example, you can set an alarm that sounds like a dog about to puke. Nothing gets you out of bed faster!  You can set alarm tones like glass breaking, angry cats fighting, someone banging your doors, Devil dog (you have to hear it to know what it is), a girl screaming no, and an assortment of outrageous and revolting sounds that aren't exactly pleasant to hear first thing in the morning, but definitely do the job of waking you up, out of your wits sometimes.  As you can make it by now, the purpose of Odd Alarm isn't to wake you up gently and pleasantly. No, the purpose of the app is to WAKE YOU UP, and that's it. The app is definitely not for the fainthearted.  Are you in the habit of snoozing your alarm multiple times? No matter with how great a resolve you go to the bed the previous night, in the morning, you run late because you snooze your alarm multiple times. This is because you haven't woken up yet and in sleep, your ultimate priority is to go back to sleep. This is why you are desperately looking for an alarm that actually works.  Although Odd Alarm allows you to snooze the alarm, there is also a complicated routine if you want to turn off the alarm. You cannot turn of the alarm simply by tapping or swiping an icon. You will need to chase the morning sun to turn off the alarm.  You can set multiple alarms if you need to be awakened or reminded of something multiple times a day. You can change themes to change the look of the interface. 10 alarm sounds come free but if you want more alarm sounds, you will need to opt for the in-app purchases. You can also purchase different cute animal themes to turn off the alarm.  What is it? Install the app and try it yourself.  The app comes with all the necessary functions to make your alarm clock as purposeful as possible. It is a complete alarm clock with the only difference that it comes with a slew of highly disturbing ring tones and alarm tones to jolt you out of your slumber.  The dog sounds are specially motivated from the experiences of dog owners and pet owners.  You can easily amplify and adjust the volume of the alarm.  Don't want to leave anything to chance and want to make sure that you wake up in the morning? You can turn off the snooze function so that the only option you have got is, wake up."

Our alarm app has been cleverly designed to force you out of your sleep by giving you various missions. For photo mode, you set it up by registering a  photo of an area or room in your house. Then once the alarm is set, the ONLY way to make it stop ringing is wake up from your sleep and go take a  photo of the registered area. Also includes math problem mode where you have to solve math problems for the alarm clock to turn off.  For ""shake mode,"" you have to shake a preset(from 30 to 999) amount of times for the alarm clock to turn off.   Users are truly enjoying this alarm app and many have devised their own unique methods around the alarm app's requirements.  For instance, you could register the foot of the bed as your location, then you would only need to wake up enough to take a picture of the foot of your bed and then go right back to sleep.  Of course, this totally circumvents the whole purpose of the app but has become a fun pastime for many users.   Works Better Than Other Alarm Clocks  Other creative locations that users have come up with include the ceiling of their room, a nightstand, or the floor.  If you’re more serious about really getting up on time, then how about registering the bathroom sink or an item in the kitchen for the picture alarm?

If you're a heavy sleeper, this is the best alarm for you that allows you to get up easily. This free and simple app has no ads or other unnecessary stuff, therefore it takes very little storage space. Combined with it's classic modern material design, the alarm is very easy to use!  You can set your own alarm sounds, for example you can use your own music and songs, nature sounds or other ringtones. Additionally you can also enable the extreme vibration feature that is also very loud.  Install Grindy Alarm now to never oversleep again and get out of bed easily!  How it works: - Set the alarm to ring at a specific time and date, or after a certain amount of time. (The app also has a timer functionality) - It rings and you turn it off, there is no snooze function. - After a few minutes you will receive a notification. Press the button on it, to show that you're awake. If you don't tap it in time (because you fell asleep again), the alarm will go off again! - This process repeats a few times (you can customize it in the settings). If you always tap the notification in time, the alarm will be disabled completely.  As you can see, it is literally impossible to oversleep with this unique method!  It also includes a digital clock that shows the time when you wake up. Of course it doesn't need internet access, it works offline. Your phone needs to be on for this android app to work!  Permissions needed: - Access device storage: This is needed only if you want to use a custom ringtone (for example your own music) - Camera: This permission is only requested if you decide to use the ""scan QR code to disable the alarm"" feature."
