When we brought our world-first decreasing premium model to the market in 2012, not many thought we’d last the year. But, here we are, not just surviving but thriving. And, we’ve evolved from being king of price, to being king of insurance.  It’s a crown we wear with pride… Not just because of how many clients love our great cover and quirky ways. Not just because we keep introducing innovative insurance products. Not just because of our award-winning royal service (yup, we’ve won stuff). Mostly because, in 6 years, we’ve given R100 million in decreasing premiums back to our clients. We think that’s pretty special.  What’s a decreasing premium  The name says it all: It’s a premium that decreases monthly instead of always going up. We figure, because your car’s value drops monthly, your car’s insurance premium should drop monthly too. It’s fair, it’s logical, and it makes sense! King Price clients also get up to 20% off when they cover 2+cars… And their premium still decreases monthly.  And, for every car that you comprehensively cover with us, you can choose to insure an Apple Watch, bicycle or set of golf clubs for just R1 monthly!  What’s portable possessions cover  Portable possessions cover will repair or replace possessions like clothing and cameras, tablets and travel luggage, and rings and sparkly things, if they’re stolen or damaged while they’re anywhere other than in your home.  We know it’s not polite to scratch around in other people’s handbags so we won’t ask you to list everything that you carry around in yours… We’ll cover these unspecified ‘everyday’ items up to an amount that you choose.  But, we do need you to specify some of your actual handbags, and a few other special portable possessions, and we’re apped to help you do this.  What’s a car self-inspection  When we insure a car for you, unless it’s brand-spanking-new off the dealership floor, we’ll need you to show us that the car actually exists. It’s not that we don’t trust you, we just like to keep our Is dotted and our Ts crossed. So, you can take it to an Autoboys branch to have it inspected, or you can DIY using our app. It’s super easy and quick, and we’ll guide you through it step by step.  What’s this about donating my decrease  This is your chance to make the circle bigger and donate your monthly decrease to a charity.  We’re all about #MakingADifference and so we’re giving you the opportunity to support some of the charities that we support. You can choose to donate your monthly decrease to any 1 of 8 charities… Just tell us which 1 tugs on your heart-strings and we’ll take care of all the details."

Unlike traditional car insurance companies that base prices on crude demographics like your age or marital status, Rooster is different.  We use our app, AI & sensors in your phone to analyse & build a profile of your driving behaviour over a 3 week period (the test drive). Then give you a quote based primarily on how, where & when you actually drive, not who you are.   By only offering quotes to safe drivers and not insuring bad drivers (the 30% of drivers who make up 50% of all claims), we pay out fewer claims & pass those savings onto our community of good drivers.  Why choose Rooster Car Insurance?  Safe drivers save up to 40%, regardless of age - Drive with the Rooster app & get a fair quote - How well you drive is the No.1 factor that determines your price - No more subsidising the cost of bad drivers’ accidents (like you do with other companies)  No more long forms - Simply enter your driving licence information, answer a few basic questions and get started in 60 secs or less - Customise your policy & make changes all within the simple intuitive app - Earn £000's by referring friends   File claims in 5 mins - Either via the app or by speaking to a human  - 24/7 customer service   High quality fully comprehensive insurance - FCA approved & regulated FCA 912547 - Data security certified ICO ZA546573  We have a few restrictions on who we can cover.

We all know it’s not easy to get insurance. Most of the time, it’s is extremely expensive, and other times a hassle and time-consuming. However, it shouldn’t have to be that way.  Why do you need car insurance?  Car insurance offers many benefits, including protecting you from incurring devastating costs and losses in the case of an accident. It provides health and lawsuit coverage and covers repair costs. It also helps to prolong the life and the value of your car.    What Type of Car Insurance Is Right for You?  There are different types of car insurance, providing different levels of financial protection, limits, and deductibles. Your choice of an insurance type will mainly depend on your needs and the persons you want the insurance to cover if an accident happens. That may include you and your family and other passengers.   With us, you can expect the most reliable and cheapest car insurance. Plus, our processes are fast and hassle-free.  Here are the four types of car insurance.  Collision insurance  This car insurance provides you with coverage for damages to your vehicle in the event when you hit another car or an object. Collision may either help to repair or replace the covered vehicle.  Rental reimbursement insurance  Rental reimbursement insurance serves to provide you with a backup means of transportation if your vehicle was involved in an accident and it’s not motorable. It covers the cost of a rental car or provides public transportation fare.   Comprehensive insurance  Comprehensive insurance is all-comprising auto insurance covering everything from damages due to collisions and specific weather events to vandalism and car theft. This car insurance can either pay for the repair costs or replace the vehicle if it’s irreparable.    Rideshare insurance Rideshare insurance offers coverage over damages sustained to your personal car when you use it for ridesharing services like Uber or Lyft. Since a personal car insurance policy does not cover vehicles used for businesses, it is essential you obtain rideshare insurance to avoid paying for damages either to the car, yourself, or someone else.   How to compare car insurance quotes?  When checking for the best car insurance quotes, you need to compare them based on similar coverages, limits, and deductibles.  Many car insurance options are available, depending on the car insurance type, state, and personal selection. With the Auto Insurance App, you can effortlessly search for the best auto coverage and check the insurance cost.   What factors influence car insurance rates?  While many factors come to play in determining the cost of a car insurance policy, the main factors include:  •	The car’s make and model •	Demographics – age, gender, marital status, zip code, and state requirements •	Driving record – yearly mileage and high-risk violations •	Credit score •	Preferred coverage, limits, and deductibles  Who requires high-risk vehicle insurance?  That mainly depends on your driving record. High-risk vehicle insurance is required for drivers who have been previously convicted for DUI (Driving Under the Influence) or DWI (Driving While Intoxicated) or have been involved in one or more auto accidents. You might also require high-risk car insurance if your car’s monetary value is high, for example, driving a more expensive car than average. Are you looking for local car insurance?  Our online car insurance service allows you to search for the nearest insurance agents to your location that can provide you with coverage that meets your needs and fits your budget.   How to make an online payment  Making an online payment for your car insurance policy with us is a breeze. You only need to provide your phone number, policy number, payment plan account number or key code, and your date of birth."
