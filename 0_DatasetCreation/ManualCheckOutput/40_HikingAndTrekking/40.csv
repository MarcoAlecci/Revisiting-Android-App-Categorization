At the beginning I thought it was only a freeride ski kind of app but I discovered it was much more! Today I use in almost all my outdoor activities. In steep skiing to see the incline, avalanche dangers with the aspect layers and discover new lines. For trail running with the different map layers to find new trails and calculate distances , for alpinism with the offline maps and the great visuals of satellite images in 3D to really have an overview of the route. Also to plan new projects or to see an activity afterwards it is very easy with the routes and waypoints. I use it today from A to Z.

Record gps tracks of your trips, analyze statistics and share them with your friends!   Geo Tracker can help: • Making the way back in an unfamiliar area without getting lost; • Sharing your route with friends; • Using someone else's route from GPX, KML or KMZ file; • Marking important or interesting points on your way; • Locating a point on the map, if you know its coordinates; • Showing off colorful screenshots of your accomplishments in social networks.   You can view the tracks and the surrounding area in the application using scheme from OSM, Google or Yandex, as well as satellite images from Google or Mapbox - this way you will always have the most detailed map of the area anywhere worldwide. The map areas you view are saved to your phone and remain available offline for a while (this works best for OSM maps and Mapbox's satellite images). To record and calculate track's statistics only a gps signal is needed - Internet is only required to download map images.   While driving, you can turn on the navigation mode, in which the map automatically rotates in the direction of travel, which greatly simplifies navigation.   The application can record tracks while being in background (on many devices, this requires additional configuration in the system - be careful! The instructions for these settings are available in the application). Power consumption in background mode is greatly optimized - on average, the phone's charge is enough for a whole day of recording. There's also an economy mode - you can turn it on in the app settings.   Geo Tracker calculates the following statistics: • Distance traveled and recording time; • Max and average speed on the track; • Time and average speed in motion; • Min and max altitude on the track, altitude difference; • Vertical distance, ascent and speed; • Min, max and average slope.   Also there are detailed charts of speed and elevation data available.   Recorded tracks can be stored as GPX, KML and KMZ files, so they can be used in other well-known applications like Google Earth or Ozi Explorer. Tracks are stored locally on your device and are not transferred to any servers.   The app does not make money from ads or your personal data. To support the development of the project, a voluntary donation can be made in the application.   Useful tips & tricks to solve common GPS issues with your smartphone: • If you start the tracking please wait with recording your activity until the GPS signal is found. • Restart your smartphone and make sure that you have ""clear view"" of the sky before you start (no disturbing objects like high buildings, forest, etc.). • The reception conditions are permanently changing because they got influenced by the following factors: weather, season, positioning of satellites, areas with bad GPS coverage, high buildings, forest, etc.). • Go to phone settings, choose ""Location"" and activate it. • Go to phone settings, choose ""Date & time"" and activate the following options: ""Automatic date & time"" and ""Automatic time zone"". It may occur that it takes longer until the GPS signal is found if your smartphone is set to the wrong time zone. • Deactivate the airplane mode in your phone settings.   If none of these tips & tricks helped to solve your issues, deinstall the app and reinstall it again. Be aware that Google uses in their Google Maps app not only the GPS data but also additional data of the current location from surrounding WLAN networks and/or mobile networks.

(1) Offline Maps: until now, when your device disconnects from the internet while recording a route, the app stops getting new terrain images to display on the map. This new feature allows you to download this map data, so that when you record a route, when disconnected, you have a map with all the terrain data.   To start using this feature, there are a couple of necessary steps. First, you must download a map by opening your user profile screen and tapping the setting button in the top right corner. Then, tap on ""Offline Maps"", next tap the add map button in the top right corner. This will show you a list of the available maps for download. Choose the map you need, and wait for it to download. Finally, you can enable this map in the route recorder by tapping the eye button and selecting the ""Offline"" option. By the way, this is currently in beta and is restricted to a limited number of maps, but we are planning on adding many more in the future.   (2) Live Tracking: you can now share your live location and your progress while recording. This feature requires that your device is connected to the internet, but do not worry if you lose connection momentarily, the app will store your progress while offline and update our Live Tracking Service when the device reconnects, so your contacts watching your progress will not miss any detail.   To enable this feature, open the route recorder, then tap the settings button in the top left and enable the ""Share Live Route"" switch, this will enable the sharing button so you can send the live tracking link to any of your contacts. This link opens our Live Tracking Service in a web browser. Anyone with the link can watch your progress, there are no user accounts needed.   (3) Geotagged Pictures: Now when adding photos to your routes, we will detect where they were captured (if available) and show them on the map of your route.

With countless areas rich in flora and fauna, it is one of the most important regions globally for biodiversity.  This is a fascinating area with varied scenery and an abundance of cultural elements. Lesvos is a destination with a unique identity. The area of Molivos and Petra will reward all visiting walkers. The app ‘Hiking on Lesvos – The Οther Aegean Trails’ is an innovative digital guide for hiking and exploring the walking trails of this beautiful island. It allows hikers to search for key elements of the natural and cultural environment, informing them about their importance as well as how they can contribute to its protection. The app provides the navigation, description, points of interest, technical characteristics and photos of nine hiking trails categorised into six groups. Eight of the trails are circular and one straight. The total length of all the trails is 112.9 km (70.2 miles).  Using filters, hikers can choose the most appropriate route for their needs. The app provides offline detailed maps and useful information about the island of Lesvos such as geography, geology, cultural heritage and hiking routes. In the field, the app shows the closest hiking trail and allows live navigation alerting users enroute with messages for points of significant interest close by. The app also has a search facility. In order to build the app and ensure the most accurate data, all the trails in the Molivos-Petra area were explored by qualified scientists and experienced hikers during autumn 2021 and spring 2022. To facilitate the fine tuning of the app, the local community was consulted including members of civil society.  Their help was critical in providing local knowledge as well as highlighting the target areas for the development of the app. The current digital app is part of a project coordinated by the Molyvos Tourism Association in cooperation with the Centre for Environmental Policy and Management Group of the Department of Environment, University of the Aegean. The project is funded by ‘Green Funds’ through the program ‘Innovative Actions for Citizens – ‘Natural Environment & Innovative Measures 2020.’"
