You can use your voice to interact with Yandex Navigator so that you don't have to take your hands off the wheel. Just say ""Hey, Yandex"" and the app will start listening for your commands. For example, ""Hey, Yandex, let's go to 1 Lesnaya Street"" or ""Hey, Yandex, take me to Domodedovo Airport"". You can also let Navigator know about road events you encounter (such as ""Hey, Yandex, there is an accident in the right lane"") or search for locations on the map (by simply saying ""Hey, Yandex, Red Square"").
